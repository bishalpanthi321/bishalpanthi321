# Hey there üëã I‚Äôm Bishal Panthi

## ‚ú® Unseen Story  

- I‚Äôm fascinated by **failure modes** in models ‚Äî knowing *when* AI fails is as important as when it succeeds.  
- I love building **little tools** that save *5 minutes* per day ‚Äî they multiply across months and teams.  
- I read *non-tech* books (philosophy, fiction) to keep my thinking flexible ‚Äî they often spark ideas for models.  
- When stuck on a bug, I sometimes sketch ideas on paper and debug *by hand* (yeah, pen and paper).

## üß† What I Actually Work On  

- **Data-centric AI pipelines** ‚Äî cleaning, annotating, versioning, and evaluating datasets for robust outcomes.  
- **Edge & deployment challenges** ‚Äî making computer vision models efficient with pruning, quantization, and distillation.  
- **Explainability & interpretability** ‚Äî building models that justify and audit their predictions (SHAP, Grad-CAM, concept methods).  
- **Connecting research to users** ‚Äî building APIs, dashboards, and UIs that make ML research accessible.

## üéØ What Drives Me  

- Automating the ‚Äúboring but critical‚Äù parts of research ‚Äî data validation, visualization, and reproducibility.  
- Designing **human-in-the-loop** pipelines where people and models collaborate, not compete.  
- Bridging the gap between theoretical ML research and usable software.  
- Making AI trustworthy enough for clinicians, researchers, and everyday users.

## üìÇ Featured Repositories  

Here are a few projects that capture my current direction:  

- ü©∫ **Explainable AI Medical Imaging Platform** ‚Äî Multi-modal diagnostic system (MRI, CT, X-ray) with natural language explanations.  
- üí° **Research Tools & Experiments** ‚Äî Lightweight utilities that improve ML workflow efficiency.  

(Expect more soon ‚Äî small tools, datasets, and visual explainers üëÄ)
