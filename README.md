# Hey there 👋 I’m Bishal Panthi

## ✨ Unseen Story  

- I’m fascinated by **failure modes** in models — knowing *when* AI fails is as important as when it succeeds.  
- I love building **little tools** that save *5 minutes* per day — they multiply across months and teams.  
- I read *non-tech* books (philosophy, fiction) to keep my thinking flexible — they often spark ideas for models.  
- When stuck on a bug, I sometimes sketch ideas on paper and debug *by hand* (yeah, pen and paper).

## 🧠 What I Actually Work On  

- **Data-centric AI pipelines** — cleaning, annotating, versioning, and evaluating datasets for robust outcomes.  
- **Edge & deployment challenges** — making computer vision models efficient with pruning, quantization, and distillation.  
- **Explainability & interpretability** — building models that justify and audit their predictions (SHAP, Grad-CAM, concept methods).  
- **Connecting research to users** — building APIs, dashboards, and UIs that make ML research accessible.

## 🎯 What Drives Me  

- Automating the “boring but critical” parts of research — data validation, visualization, and reproducibility.  
- Designing **human-in-the-loop** pipelines where people and models collaborate, not compete.  
- Bridging the gap between theoretical ML research and usable software.  
- Making AI trustworthy enough for clinicians, researchers, and everyday users.

## 📂 Featured Repositories  

Here are a few projects that capture my current direction:  

- 🩺 **Explainable AI Medical Imaging Platform** — Multi-modal diagnostic system (MRI, CT, X-ray) with natural language explanations.  
- 💡 **Research Tools & Experiments** — Lightweight utilities that improve ML workflow efficiency.  

(Expect more soon — small tools, datasets, and visual explainers 👀)
